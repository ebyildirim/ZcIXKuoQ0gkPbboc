in my code i used Random Forest Tree algorithm. My 5-fold cross validation score is 0,9191 in average. [0.922625 0.9195   0.917875 0.913375 0.922125]
I edited the data. I reduced some features and i changed numeric attributes which have many unique values with intervals.




for investment product we should prioritize personal loan, housing loan, job and balance. 
Depending on the investment, we can also add the age feature. For this issue, We can add new feature like 
average income for each job. 



We should be focusing positive balance and average income for each job. Firstly we should understand is client want inverstment.
We can find customer who want investment. We can follow what you want to invest for, with the age of the customers. We should be focusing these
features.
